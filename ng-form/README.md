# NgForm

## concepts

1. FormControl: tracks the value and validation status of an individual form control.
2. FormGroup: tracks the same values and status for a collection of form controls.
3. FormArray: tracks the same values and status for an array of form controls.
4. ControlValueAccessor: creates a bridge between Angular FormControl instances and native DOM elements.
